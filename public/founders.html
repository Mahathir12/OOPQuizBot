        <h2>Mahathir Mohammad Mahi</h2>
        <p><strong>Founder & Lead</strong> — Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, RUET.</p>
        <p>Hello and welcome!<br>
        My name is Mahathir Mohammad Mahi, and I am currently a student at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), pursuing my degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
        From the very beginning of my journey, I have been deeply passionate about technology and problem-solving. Over the past years, I have worked hard to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, C, C++, HeidiSQL, and LUA, building a solid foundation in both software development and system-level programming.
        This web application you see today is the result of 27 hours of continuous effort, creativity, and dedication. For me, it’s more than just a project—it’s a reflection of my determination to turn ideas into reality and create solutions that people can use, enjoy, and benefit from.
        I believe that innovation is born when knowledge meets perseverance. Every line of code in this project carries my vision of becoming not just a student, but a builder of meaningful technology. My goal is to continue exploring, learning, and creating tools that make an impact, however small or large.
        Thank you for visiting my work. This is just the beginning, and I am excited to grow, improve, and share many more projects with the world.</p>
